# Particle-based-reaction-diffusion-simulation-nodal-lefty
an attempt to model reaction diffusion using particles (code was prototyped quickly, hence i did not optimize it for speed)

You need Mathematica or Wolfram CDF (which is free) to view the notebooks - containing the code - properly !

the code - distributed amongst several notebooks - was an initial attempt to model a particular type of reaction-diffusion system wherein an activator and an inhibitor compete for the same receptor. The inhibitor is made to diffuse faster than the activator. The events for receptor/ligand binding, ligand decay and their auto-regulation are also introduced. The ligand tracks can be recorded to compute Mean-Square-Displacements.

**I have no intention to work on these in the near future**
