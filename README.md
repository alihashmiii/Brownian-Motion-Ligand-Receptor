an attempt to model reaction diffusion using particles

You need Mathematica to view the notebooks containing the code properly !

the code which is distributed among several notebooks was an initial attempt to model a particular type of reaction diffusion system wherein an activator and an inhibitor compete for the same receptor. The inhibitor is made to diffuse faster than the activator. Events for receptor/ligand binding, ligand decay and their auto-regulation are also introduced. Ligand tracks can be recorded to compute Mean-Square-Displacements.

I have no intention to work on these in the near future
