# Brownian-Motion-Ligand-Receptor
an attempt to model reaction diffusion using particles

Author: Ali Hashmi

this code was an initial attempt to model a particular type of reaction diffusion system with an activator and an inhibitor competing for
the same receptor. The inhibitor was made to diffuse faster than the activator. Events for receptor/ligand binding, ligand decay and their
auto-regulation were also introduced.

Ligand tracking and their MSD were computed at the end.
